# Mechatronics-Course-Project
My mechatronics course project.
This Arduino project was created by me and my group in Semester 6. 
This was our course project for the mechatronics subject.
In our project we control the temperature of a wooden block using temperature sensor, fan and an incandescent bulb.
We also had in mind using PID algorithm to strictly restrict the temperature to a fixed single point
but, due to shortage of time we had to scrap that idea.
