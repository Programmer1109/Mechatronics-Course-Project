# Mechatronics-Course-Project
My mechatronics course project.
This Arduino project was created by ma and my group in Semester 6. 
This was our course project for the mechatronics subject.
In our project we control the temperature of a wooden block using temperature sensor, fan and an incandescent bulb.
